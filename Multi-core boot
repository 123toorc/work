Multi core boot of x86 and ARM. 

BSP: bootstrip processor (work during the boot)
AP: application processor (work after kernel rised by BSP)

BSP in multicore:

NBSP: a logic BSP in a Physical cores. 
SBSP: a logic BSP in the system chosen from all NBSP.

CPU on die rom will pick a AP that with the smallest APICID(assign to by APIC increasely) to be 
a BSP in single core and NBSP in multi-core case

Unchosen core will be stay sleep and wait for SIPI(startup inter-processor interupt) 

BIOS reset vector will pick a NBSP to be a SBSP in multi-core case

SBSP start MRC(Memory Reference Code), wakeup other AP and start hardware. 

OSloader. (what is this? is this the one?)

IA32_APIC_BASE set 1 to indicate the BSP processor. 

BNR (bus not ready)

For UCSB project, the x86 BSP needs send a SIPI to the ARM BSP and let it boot the kernel.

record the APIC id.
