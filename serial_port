For serial line access. we have to config the grub. 

sometime it go for ttyS1 ttyS2

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=tty0 console=ttyS0,115200n8 console=ttyS1,115200n8 console=ttyS2, 115200n8 earlyprintk=ttyS1"

for qemu, for some machine should add flag: -cpu host -> which is host cpu passthrough, no need for emulate other CPU
